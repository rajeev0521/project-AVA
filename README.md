## Speech Output with Piper TTS

The `ava/Speech_manager.py` module enables AVA to speak responses aloud using neural text-to-speech (TTS).

### How it works
- Uses [Piper TTS](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) for fast, high-quality, offline speech synthesis.
- By default, it looks for a Piper voice model file (e.g., `en_US-amy-low.onnx`) in the project directory.
- When AVA generates a response, `Speech_manager.py` synthesizes the text and plays the audio automatically.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Download a Piper voice model**
   - Visit the [Piper voices repository](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper-voices).
   - Download a suitable `.onnx` model (e.g., `en_US-amy-low.onnx` for an English female voice).
   - Place the model file in your project directory.
   - By default, `Speech_manager.py` expects the file to be named `en_US-amy-low.onnx`. You can change the filename in the code if you use a different model.

3. **Run AVA**
   - AVA will now speak all responses aloud using the selected Piper TTS voice.

### Troubleshooting
- If you see an error about the Piper model not being found, make sure you have downloaded the `.onnx` file and placed it in the correct location.
- If you have audio playback issues, ensure your system audio is working and the `sounddevice` package is installed.
